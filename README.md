# ai-assistant

## Inspiration
Many of us have used LLMs in our daily lives, but switching back and forth can be a hassle. We wanted to create an app that is both built-in to the browser and allows for increased functionality through graphs and visualizations to help explain concepts.

## What it does
Our product acts as a real-time AI teacher that works with the user to solve problems step by step.

## How we built it
We started by implementing a simple chrome extension and then we integrated a bounding box for screenshots while implementing the Gemini and Wolfram Alpha API in conjunction, to answer the input the user gives in a real-time fashion while maintaining accuracy, whether it is a mathematical query or a non-mathematical prompt.

## Challenges we ran into
Integration of frontend and the backend was the main challenge we ran into as managing both at the same time for a chrome extension became a little complicated.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of how our AI tutor handles different types of input given by the user and adapts to each situation, even when interrupted by different inputs throughout. 

## What we learned
We learned to think on our feet and prioritize API integration rather than refining the two sides of the program before completing integral steps to getting a working model.
## What's next for Pete's Professor 
We plan on enhancing the capabilities of Wolfram Alpha in conjunction with Gemini as well as planning to integrate with tech websites such as Khan Academy and Boilerexams in order to enhance user experience.
